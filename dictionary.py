        and that "by working on its past, we will not be risking conflict with the direction of updates that Lineage will take in the future". According to Kim and Bae, the game initial \
        subtitle, "The Chaotic Chronicle", was developed with the intention to "express the large-scale war, strategies, conflicts, and collaborations that we hope to encourage among \
        players".Lead Game Designer Raoul Kim said that the reason for rendering Lineage II in 3D was "simply because most games today are [also] using 3D graphics", and because they \
        deemed it "more appropriate than 2D for the things that [they] were going to create". Developers chose to use the Unreal Engine 2 game engine because of its ability to render \
        outdoor scenes and its powerful editing features. According to Game Design team head, Cheol-Woong Hwang, there were different concepts for each of the race home villages. He \
        described the concept for the human village in Talking Island as "ordinary", while the Elven Village was designed "so as not to lose the natural and royal high-class feeling". \
        They designed the Dark Elven village based on a "grotesque and serious feeling in order to express the rough history of these who had been expelled from the Elves". There are \
        three versions of Lineage II available presently - classic, essence and Fafurion. Where the classic bears the same look and feel of the game as it was decade back, the others \

    'tekstas': 'Is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) released in 2004 by Blizzard Entertainment. Set in the Warcraft fantasy universe, World of Warcraft takes \
        place within the world of Azeroth, approximately four years after the events of the previous game in the series, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne. The game was announced in 2001, \
        and was released for the 10th anniversary of the Warcraft franchise on November 23, 2004. Since launch, World of Warcraft has had nine major expansion packs: The Burning Crusade \
        (2007), Wrath of the Lich King (2008), Cataclysm (2010), Mists of Pandaria (2012), Warlords of Draenor (2014), Legion (2016), Battle for Azeroth (2018), Shadowlands (2020), and \
        Dragonflight (2022). Similar to other MMORPGs, the game allows players to create a character avatar and explore an open game world in third- or first-person view, exploring the \
        landscape, fighting various monsters, completing quests, and interacting with non-player characters (NPCs) or other players. The game encourages players to work together to \
        complete quests, enter dungeons and engage in player versus player (PvP) combat, however, the game can also be played solo without interacting with others. The game primarily \
        focuses on character progression, in which players earn experience points to level up their character to make them more powerful and buy and sell items using in-game currency to \
        acquire better equipment, among other game systems. World of Warcraft was a major critical and commercial success upon its original release in 2004 and quickly became the most \
        popular MMORPG of all time, reaching a peak of 12 million subscribers in 2010. The game had over one hundred million registered accounts by 2014 and by 2017, had grossed over \
        $9.23 billion in revenue, making it one of the highest-grossing video game franchises of all time. The game has been cited by gaming journalists as the greatest MMORPG of all \
        time and one of the greatest video games of all time and has also been noted for its long lifespan, continuing to receive developer support and expansion packs over 15 years \
        since its initial release. In 2019, a vanilla version of the game titled World of Warcraft Classic was launched, allowing players to experience the base game before any of its \
        expansions launched, with versions of Classic for the second and third expansions being released subsequently, with minor changes. In 2022, Blizzard and NetEase cancelled an \
        unannounced World of Warcraft mobile spin-off game.'

        completing quests, and interacting with non-player characters (NPCs) or other players. Also similar to other MMORPGs, World of Warcraft requires the player to pay for a \
        subscription by using a credit or debit card, using prepaid Blizzard game cards or using a WoW Token purchased in-game. Players without a subscription may use a trial account \
        that lets the player character reach up to level 20 but has many features locked. To enter the game, the player must select a server, referred to in-game as a realm. Each realm \
        acts as an individual copy of the game world and falls into one of two categories. Available realms types are: •	Normal – a regular type realm where the gameplay is mostly \
        focused on defeating monsters and completing quests, with player-versus-player fights and any roleplay are optional. •	RP (roleplay) – which works the same way as a "Normal" \
        realm, but focuses on players roleplaying in character.Before the introduction of World of Warcraft seventh expansion "Battle for Azeroth", both "Normal" and "RP" servers were \
        each divided into two separate categories: PvE servers and PvP servers. This has since been removed after the implementation of the "War Mode" option, which allows any player \
        (of level 20 and higher) on any server to determine whether they want to actively participate in PvP combat or not, by enabling War Mode in two of the game capital cities. \
        Realms are also categorized by language, with in -game support in the language available. Players can make new characters on all realms within the region, and it is also possible \
        to move already established characters between realms for a fee.'

        factions of the Alliance or the Horde; Pandaren, which were added in Mists of Pandaria, do not commit to a faction until after the starting zone is completed. Characters from the \
        opposing factions can perform rudimentary communication (most often just "emotes"), but only members of the same faction can speak, mail, group and join guilds. The player \
        selects the new character race, such as orcs or trolls for the Horde, or humans or dwarves for the Alliance. Players must select the class for the character, with choices such as \
        mages, warriors, and priests available. Most classes are limited to particular races.'
},
    {
    'paragrafas': 'Ongoing gameplay',
    'tekstas': 'As characters become more developed, they gain various talents and skills, requiring the player to further define the abilities of that character. Characters can choose \
        two primary professions that can focus on producing items, such as tailoring, blacksmithing or jewelcrafting or on gathering from resource nodes, such as skinning or mining. \
        Characters can learn all three secondary skills: archeology, cooking, and fishing. Characters may form and join guilds, allowing characters within the guild access to the guild \
        chat channel, the guild name and optionally allowing other features, including a guild tabard, guild bank, guild repairs, and dues. Much of World of Warcraft play involves the \
        completion of quests. These quests are usually available from NPCs. Quests usually reward the player with some combination of experience points, items, and in-game money. Quests \
        allow characters to gain access to new skills and abilities, as well as the ability to explore new areas. It is through quests that much of the game story is told, both through \
        the quest text and through scripted NPC actions. Quests are linked by a common theme, with each consecutive quest triggered by the completion of the previous, forming a quest \
        chain. Quests commonly involve killing a number of creatures, gathering a certain number of resources, finding a difficult to locate object, speaking to various NPCs, visiting \
        specific locations, interacting with objects in the world, or delivering an item from one place to another to acquire experience and treasures. While a character can be played \
        on its own, players can group with others to tackle more challenging content. Most end-game challenges are designed in such a way that they can only be overcome while in a group. \
        In this way, character classes are used in specific roles within a group. World of Warcraft uses a "rested bonus" system, increasing the rate that a character can gain experience \
        points after the player has spent time away from the game. When a character dies, it becomes a ghost—or wisp for Night Elf characters—at a nearby graveyard. Characters can be \
        resurrected by other characters that have the ability or can self-resurrect by moving from the graveyard to the place where they died. If a character is past level ten and they \
        resurrect at a graveyard, the items equipped by the character degrade, requiring in-game money and a specialist NPC to repair them. Items that have degraded heavily become \
        unusable until they are repaired. If the location of the character body is unreachable, they can use a special "spirit healer" NPC to resurrect at the graveyard. When the spirit \
        healer revives a character, items equipped by the character at that time are further degraded, and the character is significantly weakened by what is in-game called "resurrection \
        sickness" for up to ten minutes, depending on the character level. This "resurrection sickness" does not occur and item degradation is less severe if the character revives by \
        locating its body, or is resurrected by another player through spells or special items. World of Warcraft contains a variety of mechanisms for player versus player (PvP) play. \
        Players on player versus environment (PvE) servers can opt to "flag" themselves, making themselves attackable to players of the opposite faction. Depending on the mode of the \
        realm, PvP combat between members of opposing factions is possible at almost any time or location in the game world—the only exception being the starting zones, where the PvP \
        "flag" must be enabled by the player wishing to fight against players of the opposite faction. PvE (called normal or RP) servers, by contrast, allow a player to choose whether or \
        not to engage in combat against other players. On both server types, there are special areas of the world where free-for-all combat is permitted. Battlegrounds, for example, are \
        similar to dungeons: only a set number of characters can enter a single battleground, but additional copies of the battleground can be made to accommodate additional players. \
        Each battleground has a set objective, such as capturing a flag or defeating an opposing general, that must be completed to win the battleground. Competing in battlegrounds \
        rewards the character with tokens and honor points that can be used to buy armor, weapons, and other general items that can aid a player in many areas of the game. Winning a \
        battleground awards more honor and tokens than losing. In addition, players also earn honor when they or nearby teammates kill players in a battleground.'

    'paragrafas': 'Setting',
    'tekstas': 'World of Warcraft is set in the same universe as the Warcraft series of real-time strategy games and has a similar art direction. World of Warcraft contains elements from \
        fantasy, steampunk, and science fiction, including gryphons, dragons, elves, steam-powered automata, zombies, werewolves, other horror monsters, time travel, spaceships, and \
        alien worlds. World of Warcraft takes place in a 3D representation of the Warcraft universe that players can interact with through their characters. The game world initially \
        consisted of the two continents in Azeroth: Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms. Four separate expansions later added to the game playable area the realms of Outland and Draenor \
        and the continents of Northrend and Pandaria. As a player explores new locations, different routes and means of transportation become available. Players can access "flight \
        masters" in newly discovered locations to fly to previously discovered locations in other parts of the world. Players can also use boats, zeppelins, or portals to move from one \
        continent to another. Although the game world remains relatively similar from day to day, seasonal events reflecting real world events, such as Halloween (Hallow End), Christmas \
        (Winter Veil), Children Week, Easter (Noblegarden), and Midsummer have been represented in the game world. Locations also have variable weather including, among other things, \
        rain, snow, and dust storms. A number of facilities are available for characters while in towns and cities. In each major city, characters can access a bank to deposit items, \
        such as treasures or crafted items. Each character has access to personal bank storage with the option to purchase additional storage space using in-game gold. Additionally, \
        guild banks are available for use by members of a guild with restrictions being set by the guild leader. Auction houses are available for players to buy and sell items to others \
        in a similar way to online auction sites such as eBay. Players can use mailboxes, which can be found in almost every town. Mailboxes are used to collect items won at auction, and \
        to send messages, items, and in-game money to other characters.Some of the challenges in World of Warcraft require players to group together to complete them. These usually take \
        place in dungeons—also known as "instances"—that a group of characters can enter together. The term "instance" comes from each group or party having a separate copy, or instance, \
        of the dungeon, complete with their own enemies to defeat and their own treasure or rewards. This allows a group to explore areas and complete quests without others interfering. \
        Dungeons are spread over the game world and are designed for characters of varying progression. A typical dungeon will allow up to five characters to enter as part of a group. \
        Some dungeons require more players to group together and form a "raid" of up to forty players to face some of the most difficult challenges. As well as dungeon-based raid \
        challenges, several creatures exist in the normal game environment that are designed for raids to attack.'

        of the version of World of Warcraft the user owns, the option to purchase expansions online was added as it allows for a quick upgrade. World of Warcraft is also available as a \
        free Starter Edition, which is free to play for an unlimited amount of time. Starter Edition characters are unable to gain experience after reaching level 20, and there are other \
        restrictions in effect for Starter Edition accounts, including the inability to trade, use mail, use Auction House, use public chat channels, join guilds or amass more than ten \
        gold. In January 2015, accounts that have lapsed subscriptions, which previously would not let a player log in, work like a restricted Starter Edition account with the one \
        difference that sub-level 20 characters will be able to join a guild if any other characters on the account are still in that guild. In April 2015, an alternate way to cover the \
        subscription was introduced. A player may spend real money ($20 in North America and differing amounts in other regions) on a WoW Token, which is sold on the auction house for \
        the in-game currency, gold, that initially could only be used to add 30 days of playtime. At the launch of the feature in North America, a token sold for 30,000 gold and 24 hours \
        later sold for 20,000 gold; therefore, the gold amount changes depending on what players are willing to spend. Subsequently, the amount that a North American token sells for \
        remained at above 30,000 gold, and the other Battle.net regions were well above that value. Once a player buys a token on the auction house, it is account bound and cannot be \
        resold. As of February 2017, the WoW Token can also be exchanged for $15 in Battle.net balance that can be used as credit for purchases in most of Blizzard games as well as in \

        across different zones to try to avoid what developers called player collision. The game interface allows players to customize appearance and controls, and to install add-ons and \

        that a player can purchase is 30 days using a credit card, or 60 using a prepaid game card. A player also has the option of purchasing three or six months of gameplay at once \
        for a 6–15(%) discount. In Australia, the United States, and many European countries, video game stores commonly stock the trial version of World of Warcraft in DVD form, \
        which includes the game and 20 levels of gameplay, after which the player would have to upgrade to a retail account by supplying a valid credit card, or purchasing a game card as \
        well as a retail copy of the game. In Brazil, World of Warcraft was released on December 6, 2011, via BattleNet. The first three expansions are currently available, fully \
        translated, including voice acting, into Brazilian Portuguese. In South Korea, there is no software package or CD key requirement to activate the account. However, to play the \
        game, players must purchase time credits online. There are two kinds of time credits available: one where the player is billed based on the actual number of minutes that will \
        be available, and one where the player can play the game for a number of days. In the former, time can be purchased in multiples of 5 hours or 30 hours, and in the latter, time \
        can be purchased in multiples of 7 days, 1 month, or 3 months. As software packages are not required, expansion pack contents are available to all players on launch day. In China, \
        because a large number of players do not own the computer on which they play games (e.g. if they play in Internet cafés), the CD keys required to create an account can be \
        purchased independently of the software package. To play the game, players must also purchase prepaid game cards that can be played for 66 hours and 40 minutes. A monthly fee \
        model is not available to players of this region. The Chinese government and NetEase, the licensee for World of Warcraft in China, have imposed a modification on Chinese versions \
        of the game which places flesh on bare-boned skeletons and transforms dead character corpses into tidy graves. These changes were imposed by the Chinese government in an attempt \
        to "promote a healthy and harmonious online game environment" in World of Warcraft. The Chinese government delayed the release of the Wrath of the Lich King expansion, due to \
        what it deemed objectionable content. NetEase took over licensing of World of Warcraft from The9 in June 2009 following the expiration of The9 contract, and were able to secure \
        a launch for Wrath of the Lich King on August 31, 2010, nearly two years after its Western release. '

        Warcraft players. It provides a way to launch World of Warcraft and starts the Blizzard updater. It was first included with the version 1.8.3 patch. The 2.1.0 patch allowed for \
        an option to bypass the use of the launcher. Features of the launcher include news and updates for World of Warcraft players, access to World of Warcraft support website, \
        access to the test version of World of Warcraft when it is available to test upcoming patches, updates to Warden, and updates to the updater itself. The 3.0.8 patch redesigned \
        the launcher and added the ability to change the game settings from the launcher itself. The launcher update from patch 4.0.1 also allows people to play the game while non-crucial \
        pieces of the game are downloaded. This requires a high-speed broadband internet connection. Patch 1.9.3 added native support for Intel-powered Macs, making World of Warcraft a \
        universal application. As a result of this, the minimum supported Mac OS X version has been changed to 10.3.9; World of Warcraft version 1.9.3 and later will not launch on older \
        versions of Mac OS X. PowerPC architecture Macs are no longer supported since version 4.0.1. When new content is added to the game, official system requirements may change. In \
        version 1.12.0 the requirements for Windows were increased from requiring 256 MB to 512 MB of RAM. Official Windows 98 technical support was dropped, but the game continued to \
        run there until version 2.2.3. Before Mists of Pandaria in 2012, World of Warcraft officially dropped support for Windows 2000, followed by Windows XP and Vista in October \
        2017, as well as all 32-bit support. Starting with 4.3, players could try out an experimental 64-bit version of the client, which required manual downloading and copying files \

        Some environments play different music depending on the time of day you are in them. The soundtrack for the original release of World of Warcraft was composed and arranged by \
        Jason Hayes, Tracy W. Bush, Derek Duke, and Glenn Stafford and conducted by Eímear Noone. Most of the music from the game and the cinematic trailers was released in the official \

    'paragrafas': 'Reception',
    'tekstas': 'World of Warcraft received very positive reviews upon release, following a period of high anticipation before launch. Although the game follows a similar model to—and was \
        noted for using many familiar concepts from—the role-playing genre, the new approaches to reducing pauses between game encounters were well liked. A common example was the \
        approach to character death. In some previous MMORPGs, a player would suffer a high penalty for character death; in World of Warcraft, a player is able to recover and start \
        playing quickly. Combat was another area where "downtime", or pauses between play, was reduced. By allowing all character types to recover from damage taken, players can return \
        to combat quickly. Reviewers felt that these changes in pacing would make the genre more accessible to casual players—those who play for short periods of time while still having \
        "deep" gameplay that would attract players of all levels of interest. The concept of a "rested bonus", or increasing the rate at which a player character gains experience, was \
        also welcomed as a way for players to quickly catch up with their friends in progression. Questing was described as an integral part of the game, often being used to continue a \
        storyline or lead the player through the game. The high number of quests in each location was popular, as well as the rewards for completing them. It was felt that the range of \
        quests removed the need for a player to "grind", or carry out repetitive tasks, to advance their character. Quests also require players to explore every section of the game world, \
        potentially causing problems for social gamers or roleplayers seeking somewhere quiet. Quests that required the player to collect items from the corpses of creatures they had \
        killed were also unpopular; the low "drop rate", or chance of finding the items, makes them feel repetitive as a high number of creatures need to be killed to complete the quest. \
        A large number of new players in a particular area meant that there were often no creatures to kill, or that players would have to wait and take turns to kill a particular \
        creature to complete a quest. Some critics mentioned that the lack of quests that required players to group up made the game feel as if it were designed for solo play. Others \
        complained that some dungeon or instanced group quests were not friendly to new players, and could take several hours to complete. Upon release, a small number of quests had \
        software bugs that made them impossible to complete. Characters were felt to be implemented well, with each class appearing "viable and interesting", having unique and different \
        mechanisms, and each of the races having a distinct look and feel. Character development was also liked, with the talent mechanism offering choice to players, and profession \
        options being praised. Character customization options were felt to be low, but the detail of character models was praised. The appearance of the game world was praised by \
        critics. Most popular was the fact that a player could run from one end of the continent to the other without having to pause at a "loading screen" while part of the game is \
        retrieved from storage. The environment was described as "breathtaking". Players found it difficult to become lost, and each area in the game world had a distinct look that \
        blended from one to the next. Critics described the environment as "a careful blend of cartoon, fantasy art, and realism". The game was found to run smoothly on a range of \
        computer systems, although some described it as basic, and mentioned that the bloom light rendering effect can blur things. One reviewer described the ability to fly over long \
        stretches of scenery as "very atmospheric". The user interface was liked, being described as "simple", with tooltips helping to get the player started. The game audio was well \
        received, particularly the background music. By assigning music to different areas of the game world, reviewers felt that the fantasy style added to the player immersion, and \
        that the replay value was increased. The sounds and voices used by characters and NPCs, as well as the overall sound effects, were felt to add a "personality" to the game.'

        users had been affected. Claims were also made that telephone support was closed for isolated periods due to the volume of calls and resulting queues. In April 2007, attacks \
        evolved to take advantage of further exploits involving animated cursors, with multiple websites being used. Security researcher group Symantec released a report stating that a \
        compromised World of Warcraft account was worth US$10 on the black market, compared to US$6 to US$12 for a compromised computer (correct as of March 2007). In February 2008, \
        phishing emails were distributed requesting that users validate their account information using a fake version of the World of Warcraft account management pages. In June 2008, \
        Blizzard announced the Blizzard Authenticator, available as a hardware security token or mobile application that provides two-factor security. The token generates a one-time \
        password based code that the player supplies when logging on. The password, used in addition to the user own password, is only valid for a couple of minutes, thus providing extra \
        security against keylogging malware. Blizzard makes use of a system known as Warden on the Windows version of the game to detect third-party programs, such as botting software, \
        allowing World of Warcraft to be played unattended. There has been some controversy as to the legality of Warden. Warden uses techniques similar to anti-virus software to analyze \
        other running software on the players PCs, as well as the file system. However, unlike most anti-virus software, it sends a portion of this information back to Blizzard, which \
        caused privacy advocates to accuse it of being spyware. One example of the information Warden collects is the title of every window open on the system while WoW is running. On \
        the other hand, many gamers responded positively to the development, stating that they supported the technology if it resulted in fewer cases of cheating. Blizzard use of Warden \
        was stated in the Terms of Agreement (TOA). The Warden existence was acknowledged in March 2008, during the opening legal proceedings against MDY Industries. The lawsuit was \
        filed in federal court in Arizona, and also listed Michael Donnelly as a defendant. Donnelly was included in the suit as the creator of MMO Glider, software that can automatically \
        play many tasks in the game. Blizzard claimed the software is an infringement of its copyright and software license agreement, stating that "Glider use severely harms the WoW \
        gaming experience for other players by altering the balance of play, disrupting the social and immersive aspects of the game, and undermining the in-game economy." Donnelly \

        which would periodically sap their life. The disease was passed on to other players simply by being near infected players. Originally this malady was confined within the Zul Gurub \
        instance, but it made its way into the outside world by way of hunter pets or warlock minions that contracted the disease. Within hours, Corrupted Blood had completely infected \
        major cities because of their high player concentrations. Low-level players were killed in seconds by the high-damage disease. Eventually, Blizzard fixed the issue so that the \

        progression, making gameplay into a shopping list and encouraging mobility rather than dominating a location. Its use of instanced dungeons let players progress together without \
        running into others, such that different areas of the game had different purposes, separating places for group challenges, mass challenges, and leveling. World of Warcraft \
        original talent system, which let players distribute points among upgrades, saw wide adoption, including by Star Wars: The Old Republic. World of Warcraft also gave structure to \

        to hundreds of hours of commitment, World of Warcraft was the most successful one in its time. "Most people", wrote Vice in 2019, "know someone who said they were addicted to \
        World of Warcraft". For some, the game became a near-total obsession taking precedent over basic necessities and relationships. The game bountiful quests provided a sense of \

        "rootless, white males" with "monster power" even prior to the rise of Reddit. He built Breitbart into a far-right news and entertainment website in part by hiring Milo \
        Yiannopoulos to pursue disaffected gamers. Vitalik Buterin, who later co-founded the cryptocurrency Ethereum, was driven to pursue decentralized technologies following a 2010 \
        patch that changed his World of Warcraft avatar preferred spell. Requests by World of Warcraft players also led Microsoft to alter how hotkeys work in their Windows operating \
        system.'

        Dealers", continues to pursue the extermination of the Lycans despite other vampires no longer believing them to be a threat. During a clash with the Lycans, Selene discovers \
        that they are looking for Michael Corvin, a seemingly ordinary medical student. Ignoring Kraven insistence to ignore the situation, Selene privately investigates Michael. After \
        approaching him, the pair find themselves pursued by a group of Lycans led by Lucian, who is still alive and manages to bite Michael during their escape. Since Kraven was the \
        only witness to Lucian supposed death, Selene comes to suspect that he lied about killing him and may be working with the Lycans. After hiding Michael at a safe house, Selene \
        returns to her coven mansion and prematurely awakens Viktor, a hibernating elder vampire. Furious, Viktor refuses to believe Selene warnings about Kraven treachery, and reminds \
        her that his fellow elder Marcus was supposed to be awakened before him. While awaiting Kraven judgment for defying him, Selene binds Michael, fearing that the Lycans bite will \
        transform him into a werewolf when the full moon rises. As the two of them bond, she gradually tells him more about her past, revealing that Viktor adopted her and turned her \
        into a vampire after her family death at the hands of Lycans, leading to vengeful campaign against them. Selene later manages to capture and abduct the Lycan scientist Singe, \
        while the Lycans manage to capture Michael. While held captive in the Lycans lair, Michael soon learns that Lucian was once in love with Viktor daughter Sonja, and that Viktor \
        murdered her after he discovered their forbidden affair. Lucian claims that Lycans were once slaves of vampires, and the war began when they rose up against them and fought for \
        their freedom. At the vampires mansion, a captive Singe reveals that Selene was telling the truth about Kraven betrayal, and he reveals why the Lycans want Michael: vampires and \
        Lycans actually have a common ancestor, and Michael is a direct descendant of that ancestor. As an heir to the legendary "Corvinus" bloodline, he carries a unique genetic strain \
        that could allow him to become a vampire-werewolf hybrid, which Singe predicts will lack the weaknesses of both species. An angered Viktor then kills Singe and mobilizes the \
        Death Dealers to raid the Lycan lair to kill the remaining Lycans, including Michael. Meanwhile, vampire elder Amelia—the ruler of the coven—is later ambushed and killed by \
        Lycans while traveling to the mansion to awaken Marcus, having tracked her with the assistance of Kraven. In the ensuing showdown between vampires and Lycans, Selene breaks into \
        the Lycans lair to rescue Michael. Kraven and Lucian turn on each other, and tells Selene that Viktor was the one who really murdered her family and only spared and mentored her \
        due to being reminded of his daughter. Selene is forced to bite a fatally injured Michael - believing that her bite will make him an immortal vampire-werewolf hybrid - while \
        Kraven shoots Lucian, killing him. When Viktor arrives at the Lycans lair in the aftermath of the battle, he admits to murdering Selene parents and killing his daughter. He also \
        insists that he killed Sonja for the good of his people and reveals she was pregnant with Lucian child, an abomination in the eyes of the two species. Lastly, he claims that he \
        made Selene immortal out of love for her. Viktor proceeds to fight the hybrid Michael. At first, Viktor is overwhelmed by Michael strength but he eventually gets the upper hand \
        and attempts to strangle him. Selene rouses from her disorientation and kills Viktor with his sword. Now enemies of both the vampires and the Lycans, Selene and Michael flee the \
        Lycans lair together. Back at the vampires mansion, Marcus — now the sole surviving vampire elder — awakens after Singe blood seeps into his sarcophagus.'

        William Corvinus, the first and most powerful werewolf. Despite Markus defiance, Viktor orders that William be imprisoned in a secret location forever. In the present day, Markus \
        awakens and kills regent Kraven. Alexander Corvinus, A.K.A Lorenz Macaro, the forefather to both the vampire and Lycan races, sends in a team of "cleaners" to investigate the \
        aftermath from the battle in the Lycans lair. Macaro examines Viktor corpse and finds a metal disc inside; it is the match to a pendant originally worn by Sonja. Michael obtained \
        the other half of the pendant after the death of Lucian. Meanwhile, vampiress Selene takes Michael to a safe house. Using the knowledge obtained from Kraven blood, Markus tracks \
        the pair down and attacks them, but they escape and hide in a warehouse. That night, Selene and Michael have passionate sexual intercourse. She later wakes up in the morning and \
        recalls seeing the pendant as a child, but does not know its significance. Wanting to know why Markus wants it, the two travel to the hideout of the exiled vampire historian \
        Andreas Tanis. Tanis reveals that Markus was the first vampire, one of the three sons of Macaro, the first immortal. Markus was bitten by a bat and metamorphosed into a vampire, \
        while William was bitten by a wolf and became a werewolf. The third son remained human and gave rise to a line of mortal descendants including Michael, who turned into the first \
        Lycan-Vampire hybrid. The first werewolves created by William were entirely animal and unable to return to their human forms. Due to William destructiveness, Markus approached \
        Viktor, then a dying mortal warlord, and offered to turn him and his army into vampires in exchange for tracking down and stopping William, and in destroying those he had \
        infected. Tanis further reveals that Selene father was the architect who built William prison and that the pendant is the key. Viktor killed Selene family because they knew the \
        prison location, but made Selene into a vampiress with the location of the prison encoded in her blood. After Selene and Michael leave, Markus arrives and drinks Tanis blood to \
        learn Selene and Michael location, killing Tanis. Selene and Michael visit Macaro, who refuses to assist Selene in killing his sons. Markus arrives, fights Michael and impales \
        him. He learns the location of William prison by drinking Selene blood, mortally wounds his father and obtains the other half of the pendant. He intends, with William, to rule \
        the world as the god-like master of a race of vampire-Lycan hybrids. On Macaro bidding, Selene drinks his blood, enhancing her physical strength and healing abilities to a level \
        equivalent to that of a hybrid. Afterwards, Macaro blows up his ship, killing himself. Selene, aboard Macaro helicopter, leads his cleaners to the prison to kill Markus, who has \
        already freed William. In the ensuing battle, William bites the cleaners, turning them into werewolves. Michael, presumed dead, awakens and joins the fight, killing William by \
        ripping his head off. Selene battles Markus and kills him by pushing him into the rotor blades of the cleaners crashed helicopter. After the battle, Selene realizes that \
        Alexander blood granted her hybrid abilities, including being immune to the effects of sunlight, which is lethal to vampires.'

        during the day and working as laborers for the vampires at night. The countryside is filled with savage werewolves born from William rampage, and human nobles beg Viktor for \
        protection against the beasts: he grants it in exchange for tributes of silver, which enables him to keep his slaves under control. As Lucian grows up, he and Viktor daughter \
        Sonja fall in love, and in their adult years they begin a secretive intimate relationship. Sonja is reckless and insubordinate, and one night Lucian escapes the shackles \

        has Lucian whipped and imprisoned. By trading her seat on the vampire council, Sonja enlists the help of Andreas Tanis in orchestrating Lucian release. Lucian, unable to flee \
        alone, liberates the other Lycans as he escapes. Sonja remains, planning to meet Lucian in three days. As she prepares to leave she is visited by her father. Viktor asks if she \

        recapture Lucian, as his Lycans have been attacking human estates, freeing their slaves and offering them immortality as Lycans themselves. Viktor replies that he is confident \
        Lucian will return as he has something Lucian wants: Sonja. Lucian learns about Sonja imprisonment and rescues her from her room, but they are stopped from escaping by Viktor. \
        Sonja, hoping to spare Lucian life, reveals to Viktor that she is pregnant with Lucian child. Disgusted, Viktor overpowers her and imprisons both her and Lucian. Sonja is \

        In December 2005, Underworld: Evolution director Len Wiseman explained that the Underworld franchise was originally conceived as a trilogy. Wiseman said, "We sort of mapped out \
        an entire history and story... a massive collection of ideas and stories that we re putting out at certain times." Wiseman anticipated creating a third installment for the \
        franchise based on the audience reception of Underworld: Evolution, which would be released the following month. In a June 2006 interview, Wiseman said, "The third film is going \
        to be a prequel. It will be the origin story and we find out things we didn t know about Lucian; he ll have a much bigger part in it. It will be about the creation [of the races] \
        and what started the war. It will be a period piece. The movie will also focus for the first time through the Lycans point of view." The director also shared, "In terms of the \

        and writing." When asked if Kate Beckinsale would reprise her role as Selene in the prequel, Wiseman said, "It will be in the time period before, but it will overlap into the \
        creation of her as well. We re in the process of seeing how far we go with that." The following October, actor Michael Sheen, who portrays Lucian in the film series, expressed \

        Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale. Joe Leydon of Variety gave a positive review, stating that director Patrick Tatopoulos \

        material, but this is easily the worst Underworld so far." While he described the franchise as "grimly competent", Glenn Whipp of Los Angeles Times criticized Rise of the Lycans \
        on its action sequences, which "accent incomprehensibility". Kim Newman of Empire rated the film one out of five stars and called it a "needless threequel", saying that it is \
        unlikely for an audience who has not seen Underworld to "follow the tosh this passes off as a plot". He adds, "In former effects man Patrick Tatopoulos vision, these Dark Ages \
        were really dark so dark, in fact, you can barely see the monster action or register why Sheen and Nighy felt the need to sign up." Richard Corliss of Time described the film \

        weaker, so David decides to take the pair to his coven. After she reluctantly drinks some blood, her wound heals. But as they do not feel welcome in the coven, due to the fact \
        that the girl is noticeably different from Vampires, Lycans and even Hybrid, Selene prepares to leave. David tries to convince her to stay and help them start an offensive \
        against the humans. Before she makes up her mind, the coven comes under attack by Lycans. Selene joins the fight and kills many Lycans before being knocked unconscious by a \
        huge "Super-Lycan" that heals instantly and is not affected by silver. She later awakenens and finds that Thomas, David father, has surrendered her daughter to the Lycans in \
        return for them leaving. David has been mortally wounded in the battle, but Selene revives him with her blood. After leaving, she confronts Sebastian, a human detective who is \
        sympathetic to the vampires due to his dead wife being a vampire. Sebastian confirms that the Lycans have been traced to Antigen, the corporation dedicated to killing off \
        vampires. They also run the facility from which Selene has escaped. Antigen is actually run by Lycans, who have been posing as humans in order to trick the world governments \
        into believing the Lycans are extinct. The director of Antigen, Dr. Jacob Lane, is trying to perfect the Lycan race and needs the DNA of Selene daughter to do so. The \
        "Super-Lycan" Selene faced earlier is Quint, Lane son and the prototype for Lycan modifications. Selene and Sebastian assault Antigen to stop Lane and save Selene daughter, who \
        they begin calling "Eve". Selene comes across Subject 0, whom she identifies as Michael, and attempts to free him by shooting his cryogenic tank. However, she is forced to leave \
        the thawing Michael in order to stop the Lycans from escaping with Eve. David, who since being healed by Selene blood has inherited her immunity to sunlight, arrives and helps \
        the heroes. In the ensuing fight, Selene confronts Quint. She tricks him into returning to his more vulnerable human form by hiding in a narrow tunnel and kills him by \
        implanting a silver grenade in his stomach. Meanwhile, Eve kills Lane by ripping out his throat. As the police arrive, Selene, Eve, and David return to Michael tank and find it \
        empty. Knowing that the world will be hunting Michael, the trio vows to find him first.'

    'tekstas': 'It like putting your wedding dress on, or putting your school uniform on, it like a time-warp feeling. Kate Beckinsale, about her return as Selene. The fourth Underworld \
        movie was in development ever since 2009, when Len Wiseman came up with the story for the film. It was actually the first original sequel story starring Selene, since originally \
        the first two films were one long script. Screenwriter John Hlavin was the first one who wrote the script based on Wiseman story that same year. Between 2009 and 2011 it went \
        through many re-writes and changes by other writers, including some who are not credited in the final film. One of the credited writers, J. Michael Straczynski, wrote his \
        version in September 2010, right when Kate Beckinsale officially signed on to star in the film. Wiseman himself also did some revisions on the script before filming started, \
        sometimes alone or with other writers. A February 2011 draft of the script lists revision credit he did with another writer, Allison Burnett, who already did his own re-write of \
        the script earlier. Despite it already going through a number of writers and different versions, the film began principal photography without a finished script in March 2011 at \
        Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, British Columbia. Due to all the changes made on the script, lot of the first promotional material was based on earlier storylines, which \
        is why it includes some differences. For example, Antigen was originally called BioCom, Selene was imprisoned by the corporation for 15 years instead of 12, her daughter was \
        originally called Nissa and she was 14 years old instead of 11, and the original title would have been Underworld 4: New Dawn, although in August 2011 interview producer Richard \
        Wright said that many different subtitles were suggested and thrown out, including Underworld 4: New Moon. Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein said in interviews that while the story \
        for the film was good, nobody was "super happy" about the script. It underwent continuous changes throughout production, with the tone of it going from more of a "wink-wink" \
        with some humor and irony, to more serious like the original films were. Mårlind and Stein also ended up working on script re-writes, along with Wiseman, producer Gary Lucchesi \
        and another new screenwriter, but none of them were credited in the film. Wright also mentioned how for some reason production of this film was more difficult than others. \
        Wiseman, who was working on the remake of Total Recall at the same time, was often called for help, and sometimes he would have to re-write a scene the night before it was \
        filmed. Mårlind and Stein also said that the entire ending is not the one which they originally had when production started, and how the ending which is in the film was written \
        during filming, although they gave no details about what the original ending was. Earlier versions of the script also included an alternate opening, in which Selene cryo tank is \
        destroyed by an escaped mutated Lycan, who would then stalk a weakened Selene around the lab until she manages to escape. This was possibly changed due to problems the scene \
        would cause with trying to cut around nudity. Selene would then find a medical gown which she would wear through the rest of the film until she finds an outfit very similar to \
        her old one inside David vampire coven. The latter part of this scene was still kept in the January and February 2011 revised drafts of the script but in the film this was \
        changed so her original outfit is kept in the same room she escapes from. The plot point about the corporation planning to use Selene and Eve as breeders of super hybrids was \
        also dropped and instead in the film they are after Eve DNA. Unfinished and constantly changing script also caused some issues for second unit director and visual effects \
        supervisor James McQuaide, who did not know how was he supposed to design Lycan creatures in the film. Some of the storyboards for the film by Martin Bergquist also reveal how \
        entire scenes including some action sequences were fully planned but ended up getting cut. Underworld Awakening is one of the first movies to be shot using RED EPIC digital \
        cameras in 3D.'

        while the Lycans, led by Marius, intend to use her to locate Eve, whose blood holds the key to building an army of vampire-werewolf hybrids. Semira, a council member of the \
        Eastern Coven, asks Thomas to plead Selene case before the council. The plea is successful and the council reluctantly agrees to a pardon in exchange for Selene help. Selene \
        arrives with David and starts training the coven neophyte Death Dealers for the upcoming war. Semira and Varga, her ally and lover, later poison Selene, slaughter the trainees \
        and frame her for the atrocity. With Selene in her custody, Semira begins draining her blood, intending to drink it to steal her power. Thomas and David attempt a rescue and \
        manage to save Selene. Unfortunately, Thomas dies in the process. David and Selene take refuge at the Nordic Coven, pursued by Alexia, an Eastern Coven vampire dispatched by \
        Semira. At Var Dohr, the Nordic Coven stronghold, Elder Vidar reveals that David is the son of Grand Elder Amelia, and thus the legitimate heir to the Eastern Coven. Meanwhile, \
        Alexia tells Marius, her secret lover, that Selene is going to the Nordic Coven. Marius and his Lycans attack Var Dohr to get her. Selene and David fight alongside the Nordic \
        vampires, who are led by Vidar daughter Lena. During the fight, Alexia stabs Selene. Marius demands to know Eve location, but finds out Selene does not know, so he sounds the \
        retreat. Selene deliberately drowns under the broken ice of the lake, telling herself that my time is done. At the Eastern Coven, Semira drinks the blood taken from Selene. \
        Alexia returns and informs her of the attack at the Nordic Coven. Semira kills Alexia, telling her that she knew of her secret alliance with Marius. David returns to the Eastern \
        Coven, presents himself as its rightful heir and denounces Semira. Even Varga deserts her, saying his loyalty is to the rightful leader. She is led off to be imprisoned in her \
        room. The coven comes under attack by Marius and his forces. The Lycans blow holes in the castle walls, letting in sunlight and killing some vampires. David continues fighting, \
        only to find himself face to face with Marius. Selene suddenly reappears, now Nordic in appearance and wearing a coat over her Death Dealer uniform. It turns out that she was \
        resurrected by the Nordic Coven and now has new powers, including enhanced speed. She swiftly dispatches the Lycans, as the Nordic Coven joins the fight. As Selene makes her way \
        through the castle, Semira escapes from her room and kills the guards. Selene and David find Marius, but David is waylaid by Semira. During the fight, a drop of Marius blood \
        lands on Selene lips and she is suddenly flooded by his memories. She sees Marius capturing Michael Corvin and slitting his throat to collect his blood and consume it. To \
        counter her despair over Michael death, she bites her own wrist, accessing her own blood memories of time spent with him. Selene then rips out Marius spine, killing him \

        succession of drummers, most notably Chad Channing, and then recruited Dave Grohl in 1990. Nirvana success popularized alternative rock, and they were often referenced as the \
        figurehead band of Generation X. Their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock culture. In the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part \
        of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album, Bleach, for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often \
        between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label DGC Records in 1991, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with "Smells Like Teen Spirit", the \
        first single from their landmark second album Nevermind (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, Nevermind was certified Diamond by the RIAA and is credited for ending the \
        dominance of hair metal. Characterized by their punk aesthetic, Nirvana fusion of pop melodies with noise, combined with their themes of abjection and social alienation, brought \
        them global popularity. Following extensive tours and the 1992 compilation album Incesticide and EP Hormoaning, the band released their highly anticipated third studio album, In \
        Utero (1993). The album topped both the US and UK album charts, and was acclaimed by critics. Nirvana disbanded following Cobain suicide in April 1994. Various posthumous \
        releases have been overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain widow Courtney Love. The posthumous live album MTV Unplugged in New York (1994) won Best Alternative Music \
        Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards. Nirvana is one of the best-selling bands of all time, having sold more than 75 million records worldwide. During their three years as a \
        mainstream act, Nirvana received an American Music Award, Brit Award and Grammy Award, as well as seven MTV Video Music Awards and two NME Awards. They achieved five number-one \
        hits on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and four number-one albums on the Billboard 200. In 2004, Rolling Stone named Nirvana among the 100 greatest artists of all time. \

        Matter. Three years after the two first met, Novoselic notified Cobain that he had finally listened to the Fecal Matter demo and suggested they start a group. Their first band, \
        the Sellouts, was a Creedence Clearwater Revival tribute band. The project featured Novoselic on guitar and vocals, Cobain on drums, and Steve Newman on bass but only lasted a \
        short time. Another project, this time featuring originals, was also attempted in late 1986. Bob McFadden was enlisted to play drums, but after a month this project also fell \

        Endino. Bleach was influenced by the heavy dirge-rock of the Melvins, the 1980s punk rock of Mudhoney, and the 1970s heavy metal of Black Sabbath. The money for the recording \

        with Mudhoney drummer Dan Peters. Dale Crover filled in on drums on Nirvana seven-date American West Coast tour with Sonic Youth that August. In September 1990, Buzz Osborne of \
        the Melvins introduced the band to drummer Dave Grohl, whose Washington, D.C. band Scream had broken up. Grohl auditioned for Novoselic and Cobain days after arriving in \
        Seattle; Novoselic later said, "We knew in two minutes that he was the right drummer." Grohl told Q: "I remember being in the same room with them and thinking, What? That \
        Nirvana? Are you kidding? Because on their record cover they looked like psycho lumberjacks... I was like, What, that little dude and that big motherfucker? You re kidding me.'

    'tekstas': 'Disenchanted with Sub Pop, and with the Smart Studios sessions generating interest, Nirvana sought a deal with a major record label since no indie label could buy them \
        out of their contract. Cobain and Novoselic consulted Soundgarden and Alice in Chains manager Susan Silver for advice. They met Silver in Los Angeles and she introduced them to \
        agent Don Muller and music business attorney Alan Mintz, who was specialized in finding deals for new bands. Mintz started sending out Nirvana demo tape to major labels looking \
        for deals. Following repeated recommendations by Sonic Youth Kim Gordon, Nirvana signed to DGC Records in 1990. When Nirvana was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in \
        2014, Novoselic thanked Silver during his speech for "introducing them to the music industry properly". After signing, the band began recording its first major label album, \
        Nevermind. The group was offered a number of producers, but held out for Vig. Rather than record at Vig Madison studio as they had in 1990, production shifted to Sound City \
        Studios in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California. For two months, the band worked through a variety of songs. Some, such as "In Bloom" and "Breed", had been in Nirvana repertoire \
        for years, while others, including "On a Plain" and "Stay Away", lacked finished lyrics until midway through the recording process. After the recording sessions were completed, \
        Vig and the band set out to mix the album. However, the recording sessions had run behind schedule and the resulting mixes were deemed unsatisfactory. Slayer mixer Andy Wallace \
        was brought in to create the final mix. After the album release, members of Nirvana expressed dissatisfaction with the polished sound the mixer had given Nevermind. Announcement \
        from the band encouraging people to participate in the making of the music video for "Smells Like Teen Spirit".Initially, DGC Records was hoping to sell 250,000 copies of \
        Nevermind, the same they had achieved with Sonic Youth Goo. However, the first single "Smells Like Teen Spirit" quickly gained momentum, boosted by major airplay of the music \
        video on MTV. As it toured Europe during late 1991, the band found that its shows were dangerously oversold, that television crews were becoming a constant presence onstage, and \
        that "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was almost omnipresent on radio and music television. By Christmas 1991, Nevermind was selling 400,000 copies a week in the US. In January 1992, \
        the album displaced Michael Jackson Dangerous at number one on the Billboard album charts, and topped the charts in numerous other countries. The month Nevermind reached number \
        one, Billboard proclaimed, "Nirvana is that rare band that has everything: critical acclaim, industry respect, pop radio appeal, and a rock-solid college/alternative base." The \
        album eventually sold over seven million copies in the United States and over 30 million worldwide. Nirvana sudden success was credited for popularizing alternative rock and \
        ending the dominance of hair metal. Citing exhaustion, Nirvana did not undertake another American tour in support of Nevermind, and made only a handful of performances later \
        that year. In March 1992, Cobain sought to reorganize the group songwriting royalties (which to this point had been split equally) to better represent that he wrote the majority \
        of the music. Grohl and Novoselic did not object, but when Cobain wanted the agreement to be retroactive to the release of Nevermind, the disagreements came close to breaking up \
        the band. After a week of tension, Cobain received a retroactive share of 75 percent of the royalties. Bad feelings about the situation remained within the group afterward. \
        Amid rumors that the band was disbanding due to Cobain health, Nirvana headlined the closing night of England 1992 Reading Festival. Cobain personally programmed the performance \
        lineup. Nirvana performance at Reading is often regarded by the press as one of the most memorable of the group career. A few days later, Nirvana performed at the MTV Video \
        Music Awards; despite the network refusal to let the band play the new song "Rape Me", Cobain strummed and sang the first few bars of the song before breaking into "Lithium". \
        The band received awards for the Best Alternative Video and Best New Artist categories. DGC had hoped to have a new Nirvana album ready for a late 1992 holiday season; instead, \
        it released the compilation album Incesticide in December 1992. A joint venture between DGC and Sub Pop, Incesticide collected various rare Nirvana recordings and was intended \
        to provide the material for a better price and higher quality than bootlegs. As Nevermind had been out for 15 months and had yielded a fourth single in "In Bloom" by that point, \
        Geffen/DGC opted not to heavily promote Incesticide, which was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America the following February.'

        chose producer Steve Albini, who had a reputation as principled and opinionated in the American indie music scene. While some speculated that Nirvana chose Albini for his \
        underground credentials, Cobain said they chose him for his "natural" recording style, without layers of studio trickery. Albini and Nirvana recorded the album in two weeks in \
        Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, that February for $25,000. After its completion, stories ran in the Chicago Tribune and Newsweek that quoted sources claiming DGC \
        considered the album "unreleasable". Fans became concerned that Nirvana creative vision might be compromised by their label. While the stories about DGC shelving the album were \
        untrue, the band was unhappy with certain aspects of Albini mixes; they thought the bass levels were too low, and Cobain felt that "Heart-Shaped Box" and "All Apologies" did not \
        sound "perfect". Longtime R.E.M. producer Scott Litt was called in to remix the two songs, with Cobain adding more instrumentation and backing vocals. In Utero topped the \
        American and British album charts. Time critic Christopher John Farley wrote in his review, "Despite the fears of some alternative-music fans, Nirvana hasn t gone mainstream, \
        though this potent new album may once again force the mainstream to go Nirvana." In Utero went on to sell over 5 million copies in the United States. That October, Nirvana \
        embarked on its first tour of the United States in two years with support from Half Japanese and the Breeders. For the tour, the band added Pat Smear of the punk rock band Germs \
        as second guitarist. In November, Nirvana recorded a performance for the television program MTV Unplugged. Augmented by Smear and cellist Lori Goldston, they broke convention \
        for the show by choosing not to play their best known songs. Instead, they performed several covers, and invited Cris and Curt Kirkwood of the Meat Puppets to join them for \
        renditions of three Meat Puppets songs. In early 1994, Nirvana embarked on a European tour. Their final concert took place in Munich, Germany, on March 1. In Rome, on the \
        morning of March 4, Cobain wife, Courtney Love, found Cobain unconscious in their hotel room and he was rushed to the hospital. Cobain had reacted to a combination of prescribed \
        Rohypnol and alcohol. The rest of the tour was canceled. In the ensuing weeks, Cobain heroin addiction resurfaced. Following an intervention, Cobain was persuaded to enter drug \
        rehabilitation. After less than a week, he left the facility without informing anyone, then returned to Seattle. One week later, on April 8, 1994, Cobain was found dead of a \
        self-inflicted shotgun wound at his home in the Denny-Blaine neighborhood of the city.'

        Brixton Academy, who lied on BBC Radio 1 that fans were purchasing tickets as a "piece of history", in an effort to retain the money he stood to lose from ticket refunds. A \
        public vigil for Cobain was held on April 10, 1994, at a park at Seattle Center, drawing approximately 7,000 mourners, followed by a final ceremony on May 31, 1999. Plans for a \

        for release in October 2001. However, shortly before the release date, Love filed a suit to dissolve Nirvana LLC, and an injunction was issued preventing the release of any new \
        Nirvana material until the case was resolved. Love contended that Cobain was Nirvana, that Grohl and Novoselic were sidemen, and that she had signed the partnership agreement \
        originally under bad advice. Grohl and Novoselic countersued, asking the court to remove Love from the partnership and to replace her with another representative of Cobain \
        estate. The day before the case was set to go to trial in October 2002, Love, Novoselic, and Grohl announced that they had reached a settlement. The next month, the best-of \

    'pavadinimas': 'Musical style',
    'tekstas': 'Nirvana musical style has been mainly described as grunge, punk rock, and alternative rock. They have also been labeled as hard rock. Characterized by their punk \
        aesthetic, Nirvana fused pop melodies with noise. Billboard described their work as a "genius blend of Kurt Cobain raspy voice and gnashing guitars, Dave Grohl relentless \
        drumming and Krist Novoselic uniting bass-work that connected with fans in a hail of alternately melodic and hard-charging songs". Cobain described Nirvana initial sound as \
        "a Gang of Four and Scratch Acid ripoff". When Nirvana recorded Bleach, Cobain felt he had to fit the expectations of the Sub Pop grunge sound to build a fanbase, and suppressed \
        his arty and pop songwriting in favor of a more rock sound. Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad argued, "Ironically, it was the restrictions of the Sub Pop sound that helped the \
        band find its musical identity." Azerrad stated that by acknowledging that they had grown up listening to Black Sabbath and Aerosmith, they had been able to move on from their \
        derivative early sound. Nirvana used dynamic shifts that went from quiet to loud. Cobain sought to mix heavy and pop musical sounds, saying, "I wanted to be totally Led Zeppelin \
        in a way and then be totally extreme punk rock and then do real wimpy pop songs." When Cobain heard the Pixies 1988 album Surfer Rosa after recording Bleach, he felt it had the \
        sound he wanted to achieve but had been too intimidated to try. The Pixies subsequent popularity encouraged Cobain to follow his instincts as a songwriter. Like the Pixies, \
        Nirvana moved between "spare bass-and-drum grooves and shrill bursts of screaming guitar and vocals". Near the end of his life, Cobain said the band had become bored of the \
        "limited" formula, but expressed doubt that they were skilled enough to try other dynamics. Cobain rhythm guitar style, which relied on power chords, low-note riffs, and a loose \
        left-handed technique, featured the key components to the band songs. Cobain would often initially play a song verse riff in a clean tone, then double it with distorted guitars \
        when he repeated the part. In some verses, the guitar would be absent to allow the drums and bass guitar to support the vocals, or it would only play sparse melodies like the \
        two-note pattern used in "Smells Like Teen Spirit". Cobain rarely played standard guitar solos, opting to play variations of the song melody as single-note lines. Cobain solos \
        were mostly blues-based and discordant, which music writer Jon Chappell described as "almost an iconoclastic parody of the traditional instrumental break", a quality typified \
        by the note-for-note replication of the lead melody in "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and the atonal solo for "Breed". The band had no formal musical training; Cobain said: "I have \
        no concept of knowing how to be a musician at all whatsoever... I couldn t even pass Guitar 101." Grohl drumming "took Nirvana sound to a new level of intensity". Azerrad stated \
        that Grohl "powerful drumming propelled the band to a whole new plane, visually as well as musically", noting, "Although Dave is a merciless basher, his parts are also \
        distinctly musical—it wouldn t be difficult to figure out what song he was playing even without the rest of the music". Until early 1992, the band had performed live in concert \
        pitch. They began tuning down either a half step or full step as well as concert pitch. Sometimes all three tunings would be in the same show. By the summer of that year, the \
        band had settled on the half step down tuning. Cobain said, "We play so hard we can t tune our guitars fast enough".The band made a habit of destroying its equipment after \
        shows. Novoselic said he and Cobain created the "shtick" in order to get off of the stage sooner. Cobain stated it began as an expression of his frustration with previous \
        drummer Channing making mistakes and dropping out entirely during performances.'

    'paragrafas': 'Songwriting and lyrics',
    'tekstas': 'Everett True said in 1989, "Nirvana songs treat the banal and pedestrian with a unique slant".Cobain came up with the basic components of each song, usually writing them \
        on an acoustic guitar, as well as the singing style and the lyrics. He emphasized that Novoselic and Grohl had a large part in deciding the lengths and parts of songs, and that \
        he did not like to be considered the sole songwriter. Cobain usually wrote lyrics for songs minutes before recording them. Cobain said, "When I write a song the lyrics are the \
        least important subject. I can go through two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all". Cobain told Spin in 1993 that he "didn t \
        give a flying fuck" what the lyrics on Bleach were about, figuring "Let just scream some negative lyrics and as long as they re not sexist and don t get too embarrassing it ll \
        be okay", while the lyrics to Nevermind were taken from two years of poetry he had accumulated, which he cut up and chose lines he preferred from. In comparison, Cobain stated \
        that the lyrics to In Utero were "more focused, they re almost built on themes". Cobain did not write in a linear fashion, instead relying on juxtapositions of contradictory \
        images to convey emotions and ideas. Often in his lyrics, Cobain would present an idea then reject it; he said, "I m such a nihilistic jerk half the time and other times I m so \
        vulnerable and sincere [.. The songs are] like a mixture of both of them. That how most people my age are."'

    'paragrafas': 'Legacy',
    'tekstas': 'Combined with their themes of abjection and alienation, Nirvana became hugely popular during their short tenure and are credited with bringing alternative rock to the \
        mainstream. Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that prior to Nirvana, "alternative music was consigned to specialty sections of record stores, and major labels considered it to be, \
        at the very most, a tax write-off". Following the release of Nevermind, "nothing was ever quite the same, for better and for worse". While other alternative bands had achieved \
        hits, Nirvana "broke down the doors forever", according to Erlewine; the breakthrough "didnt eliminate the underground", but rather "just gave it more exposure". Erlewine also \
        wrote that Nirvana "popularized so-called Generation X and slacker culture". Following Cobain death, numerous headlines referred to Nirvana frontman as "the voice of a \
        generation", although he had rejected such labeling during his lifetime. In 1992, Jon Pareles of The New York Times reported that Nirvana had made other alternative acts \
        impatient for similar success: "Suddenly, all bets are off. No one has the inside track on which of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of ornery, obstreperous, unkempt bands might next \
        appeal to the mall-walking millions." Record company executives offered large advances and record deals to bands, and previous strategies of building audiences for alternative \
        rock groups were replaced by the opportunity to achieve mainstream popularity quickly. Michael Azerrad argued in his Nirvana biography Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana \
        (1993) that Nevermind marked an epochal generational shift in music similar to the rock-and-roll explosion in the 1950s and the end of the baby boomer generation dominance of \
        the musical landscape. Azerrad wrote, "Nevermind came along at exactly the right time. This was music by, for, and about a whole new group of young people who had been \
        overlooked, ignored, or condescended to." Fugazi frontman Guy Picciotto said: "It was like our record could have been a hobo pissing in the forest for the amount of impact it \
        had ... It felt like we were playing ukuleles all of a sudden because of the disparity of the impact of what they did." Nirvana is one of the best-selling bands of all time, \
        having sold more than 75 million records. With more than 28 million RIAA-certified units, Nirvana is also one of the best-selling music artists in the United States. They have \
        achieved ten top 40 hits on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart, including five number-ones. Two of their studio albums and two of their live albums have reached the top spot \
        on the Billboard 200. Nirvana has been awarded one diamond, three multiplatinum, seven platinum and two gold-certified albums in the United States by the RIAA, and four \
        multiplatinum, four platinum, two gold and one silver-certified albums in the UK by the BPI. Nevermind, their most successful album, has sold more than 30 million copies \
        worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums ever. Their most successful song, "Smells Like Teen Spirit", is among the best-selling singles of all time, having sold 8 \

        kilęs iš Archangelsko, nuo 1966 m. dirbo Lietuvoje rentgenologu, radiologu, vadovavo Vilniaus Santariškių radiologijos skyriui. Motina - lietuvė Margarita Mamontova (mergautinė \
        pav. Čiplytė), taip pat medikė, Vilniaus medicinos mokyklos dėstytoja. Mokėsi Vilniaus 18-oje vidurinėje mokykloje, ją baigęs įstojo į Vilniaus inžinerinį statybos institutą, \
        į statybos ekonomikos specialybę, vėliau į Vilniaus universitetą, žurnalistikos specialybę. 1983 m. rudenį Andrius Mamontovas (vokalas, mušamieji), Arnoldas Lukošius \
        (klavišiniai) ir Darius Tarasevičius (boso gitara) Vilniaus 18-oje vidurinėje mokykloje įkūrė grupę „Sunki muzika“. Tai buvo vienos populiariausių visų laikų Lietuvos roko \
        grupės „Foje“ gyvavimo pradžia. 1996 m. įkūrė labdaros fondą „Muzikantai vaikams“, kuris Lietuvos vaikų namams nupirko bei išdalino knygų bei kitų mokymosi-lavinimosi priemonių \
        už beveik 100 000 litų, kurie buvo surinkti specialiai tam surengto festivalio „PARAMA“ metu. 1997 m. režisieriaus Eimunto Nekrošiaus spektaklyje „Hamletas“ atliko pagrindinį \
        vaidmenį, už kurį buvo apdovanotas specialiuoju prizu - Boriso Dauguviečio „Auksiniu auskaru“. Spektaklis yra suvaidintas 210 kartų ir parodytas 39-iose pasaulio šalyse: \
        Europoje, Azijoje ir Šiaurės bei Pietų Amerikoje. 2002 m. parašė muziką to paties E. Nekrošiaus režisuotam spektakliui „Ivanov“, pastatytame Romos (Italija) teatre \
        „Teatro Argentina“. 1997 gegužės 17 d. surengė paskutinį grupės „Foje“ koncertą. Į Vilniaus Vingio parką susirinko apie 60 tūkst. grupės gerbėjų. Taip buvo pasiektas didžiausią \
        žiūrovų skaičių surinkusio koncerto rekordas Lietuvoje (2020 m. duomenimis). 1998 m. rugsėjo 23 d. pradėjo solinę karjerą koncertu Vilniuje, Spaudos rūmų salėje, vėliau \
        koncertavo visoje Lietuvoje. 2001 m. dalyvavo nacionalinėje Eurovizijos atrankoje. Nors publikos ir buvo išrinktas nugalėtoju, žiuri jam skyrė antrąją vietą ir į Kopenhagą \
        išsiuntė Skamp. 2004 m. sausio 31 d. „Radiocentro“ dainininkui buvo įteiktas „auksinio“ singlo apdovanojimas už dainą „Kregždutės, kregždutės“. Vasario 27 d. laimėjo du \
        prestižinius apdovanojimus dešimtuosiuose „Bravo“ rinkimuose. Geriausiu albumu pripažintas diskas „Beribiam danguje“, geriausia daina tituluotos „Kregždutės“. Šie apdovanojimai \
        vainikavo aktyvią muzikinę ir koncertinę 2003 m. Andriaus Mamontovo veiklą. Iš viso dainininkas per savo muzikinę karjerą yra laimėjęs dvylika „Bravo“ apdovanojimų. „Bravo 2003“ \
        ceremonijoje jis ne tik atsiėmė prizus, bet ir paskelbė nominacijos „Už nuopelnus lietuviškai popkultūrai“ nugalėtoją, kuriuo tapo kompozitorius Giedrius Kuprevičius. Renginio \
        metu, kurį tiesiogiai transliavo LNK televizija, Mamontovas pateikė staigmeną, atlikdamas netikėtą dainos „Pavasariniai žiedai“ versiją. Ekstravagantiškai apsirengusi trijulė - \
        Andrius Mamontovas, Arnoldas Lukošius ir Eimantas Belickas - pelnė publikos simpatijas, šią dainą temperamentingai atlikę elektroniniu grunge stiliumi. Rugsėjo 1 d. Vilniaus \
        Vingio parke įvyko miuziklo „Tadas Blinda“ premjera, kuriame pagrindinį vaidmenį atliko ir muziką sukūrė Andrius Mamontovas. Tą pačią dieną buvo išleistas ir šio miuziklo \
        kompaktinis diskas. 2006 m. nugalėjo nacionalinėje Eurovizijos atrankoje su grupe „LT United“ ir atstovavo Lietuvai „Eurovizijos“ dainų konkurse, kur užėmė šeštąją vietą - tai \
        aukščiausias ligšiolinis Lietuvos atlikėjų pasiekimas. Tais pačiais metais išleido albumus „Saldi. Juoda. Naktis.“ ir „Tyla“, taip pat pasirašė sutartį su JAV įrašų kompanija \
        „Forman Bross“, kurios dėka jo muziką ėmė groti Amerikos kino teatruose. 2007 m. eilinį kartą laimėjo geriausio metų atlikėjo nominacijoje Radiocentro muzikiniuose \
        apdovanojimuose, tačiau atsiimti apdovanojimo neatvyko. Tais pačiais metais surengė „Gatvės muzikos dieną“, kuri sulaukė didelio populiarumo ne tik Vilniuje, bet ir kituose \
        Lietuvos miestuose. Nuo tada ši muzikos šventė tapo kasmetine, apimančia vis daugiau Lietuvos miestų. Vienas populiariausių Lietuvos dainininkų Andrius Mamontovas debiutavo kaip \
        fotografas. Italijoje buvo išleista vienos dainininko bičiulės knyga, kurios apipavidalinimui pasirinktos ir kelios A. Mamontovo 2006 m. Korėjoje darytos fotografijos. 2008 m. \
        atliko kunigo vaidmenį pilnametražiame režisieriaus Mario Martinsono filme „Nereikalingi žmonės“ bei sukūrė šio filmo garso takelį. Jame taip pat vaidino Dalia Michelevičiūtė, \
        Kostas Smoriginas, Valda Bičkutė, Daiva Tamošiūnaitė-Budrė ir kt. Filmo premjera įvyko sausio 11 d. „Kuriant muziką filmui, tiesiog stengiausi išreikšti tą nuotaiką, kuri \
        papildytų filmo personažus - viename savo interviu sakė A. Mamontovas, - muzika filmui ar spektakliui, tai ne tik muzikinės temos. Tai atmosferos kūrimas, garsai“. Už šį darbą \
        atlikėjas buvo apdovanotas Šanchajaus filmų festivalyje prizu (auksine taure) už geriausią muziką filmui. 2009 m. sausio mėn. laimėjo Radiocentro muzikiniuose apdovanojimuose \
        „Apdo 2009“ Geriausio metų dainininko kategorijoje. Neatvykęs į ceremoniją ir iš jam perdavusių Arnoldo Lukošiaus ir Eimanto Belicko atsiėmęs apdovanojimą, savo požiūrį į jį \
        išreiškė įmetęs į upę, visa tai nufilmavęs ir video pavadinęs „Apdo vanojimas“. 2010 m. pasirodė dar viena režisieriaus Mario Martinsono juosta „Amaya“, filmuota Honkonge ir \
        kt., kurioje pagrindinį herojų - tatuiruotą keliautoją po pasaulį Polą - suvaidino A. Mamontovas. Filmą kūrė studija „Krukfilms“ (Latvija), bendradarbiaudama su studija \
        „October Pictures“ (Honkongas). Kartu su dainininku filme vaidina japonų aktorė Kaori Mamoi ir britų aktorius Dexter Fletcher. A. Mamontovas taip pat sukūrė ir šio filmo \
        muzikinį takelį, kuriame yra ir baladės „Heal“ ir „World Is Full of Love“. 2011 m. rugpjūčio 17 d. SoundCloud portale patalpino perrašytą „Visi langai žiūri į dangų“ albumą. \
        Šiame darbe likusios kai kurios elektrinės gitaros (Romas Rainys), bosinės gitaros (Seržas Grėjus) ir smuiko (Eimantas Belickas) partijos. 2012 m. Sukūrė muziką Eimunto \
        Nekrošiaus spektakliui „Dieviškoji komedija“. 2013 m. kartu su kitais „Foje“ nariais surengė koncertų turą po Lietuvą savo veiklos 30 metų jubiliejui paminėti.'

        known as the "Kami Band" at performances. The band was formed in 2010, with the original lineup of Su-metal (vocal and dance), Moametal (scream and dance), and Yui Mizuno as \
        "Yuimetal" (scream and dance), with the concept of creating a fusion of the heavy metal and Japanese idol genres. Originally a sub-unit of the Japanese idol group Sakura Gakuin, \
        Babymetal became an independent act in 2013, following Nakamoto departure from Sakura Gakuin. Babymetal released their eponymous debut album in February 2014. Their second album \
        Metal Resistance was released worldwide in April 2016. Babymetal has also embarked on several tours, with a majority of their tour dates taking place outside of Asia. The group \

        absence from live performances since December 2017.[1] Since her departure, the band has performed with backup dancers at live performances. In 2019, the band introduced three \

        Suzuka Nakamoto performance with her previous group Karen Girl, thinking she would be suitable as the lead vocalist for the new group. The band was formed in 2010 in Tokyo, \
        Japan, as the heavy music club (重音部, Jūonbu), or sub-unit, of the female idol group Sakura Gakuin, which was also newly formed that year. The band name is a combination of \
        "baby" (ベビー, bebī) and "heavy metal" (ヘビーメタル, hebī metaru), and the Japanese pronunciation rhymes with "heavy metal". According to Kobametal, Yui Mizuno and Moa Kikuchi \
        were added to complement Nakamoto "unique stage presence" with their smaller statures, dancing around her "like angels". None of the three members were familiar with metal music \
        before the inception of the band. Babymetal first live appearance was on November 28, 2010, at Sakura Gakuin first solo concert, Sakura Gakuin Festival ☆ 2010. In July 2011, \
        Babymetal premiered the song, "Ijime, Dame, Zettai" ("No More Bullying"), at a Sakura Gakuin concert, but it would only be performed during live concerts for the time being. The \

        Records. The music video totaled over 1 million views by the end of 2012. Babymetal first CD single was a collaboration with the band Kiba of Akiba, titled "Babymetal / Kiba of \
        Akiba". Released in March 2012 by Juonbu Records, the single ranked at number three on the Oricon weekly indie chart, and number one in the Tower Records Shibuya weekly indie \
        ranking. In the summer of 2012, the band released a music video for their next single, "Headbangeeeeerrrrr!!!!!", directed by Hidenobu Tanabe. In August 2012, Babymetal debuted \
        at Japan Summer Sonic Festival, becoming the youngest act ever to perform at the festival, at the average age of 12. The same year, Babymetal performed outside of Japan for the \

        it represents who they are and what they do as Babymetal. Su-metal said that "it about them exploring new, different aspects of what they can do." On March 13, the band \
        producer, Kobametal, received an Excellence Award from the Association of Media in Digital (AMD) in Japan for his success in promoting the band internationally. On April 2, one \
        day after the release of Metal Resistance, Babymetal became the first Japanese act to headline Wembley Arena, with the largest sale of merchandise for a single day event in the \
        venue history, coinciding with the highest ever entry for an album in the UK charts for a Japanese act. The Guardian gave their Wembley performance a rating of five out of five \
        stars. On April 5, Babymetal made their U.S. television debut, performing "Gimme Chocolate!!" on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Babymetal were added as a character skin in \
        the Wii U video game Super Mario Maker in 2016. On May 26, 2016, WWE Triple H announced on Twitter that Babymetal song "Karate", along with A Day to Remember "Paranoia", would \
        be used as official theme songs of NXT TakeOver: The End. On July 18, the band made a special appearance at the Alternative Press Music Awards where they performed "Karate" \
        before being joined onstage by Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford. Halford, along with Nakamoto and the Kami Band, performed an abridged version of "Painkiller", followed by a \
        performance of "Breaking the Law" where they were rejoined by Mizuno and Kikuchi on guitars. On July 27, Metal Hammer readers voted Babymetal debut album as the best album of \
        the 21st century. In September 2016, Warner Bros. announced that a hybrid live action-animation fantasy-adventure short form series featuring the members of the band was under \
        development. The series would be developed by Blue Ribbon Content in collaboration with Amuse Group USA (an Amuse Inc. subsidiary based in the United States). The band producer, \
        Kobametal, is also involved with production of the series. On September 19 (Red Night) and September 20, 2016 (Black Night), Babymetal ended their Babymetal World Tour 2016: \
        Legend Metal Resistance by performing at the Tokyo Dome, with both nights sold out and approximately 55,000 people attending each night. These included fans from Japan and many \
        others from around the world. Yuimetal admitted she was "still in shock" that she was playing at the venue. Moametal felt the same, calling it "a big challenge for young girls \
        of our age to stand on that stage". Su-metal explained that "In Japan we have played many big venues like Budokan and others, but Tokyo Dome was always a place that I have been \
        dreaming of performing at." In December 2016, Babymetal supported the Red Hot Chili Peppers during The Getaway World Tour in the UK. During their final show on the tour, Red Hot \
        Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith joined Babymetal onstage to perform their covers of Judas Priest "Painkiller" and "Breaking the Law". After the performance, Smith thanked \
        Babymetal for being on tour with them and led the audience in singing "Happy Birthday" to Su-metal. In January 2017, Babymetal supported Metallica for their WorldWired Tour at \
        Gocheok Sky Dome and also appeared in Japan performance of the Guns N'' Roses Not in This Lifetime... Tour as the opening act. In April 2017, Babymetal supported the Red Hot \
        Chili Peppers during The Getaway World Tour in the US. In June 2017, Babymetal performed at the KISW Pain in the Grass music event in Auburn, Washington. During the summer of \
        2017, they supported Korn on their Serenity of Summer Tour. Afterwards, they commenced their The Five Fox Festival in Japan tour. In October 2017, Babymetal were officially \
        revealed as the performers of the "Unikitty Theme" for the Unikitty! TV series. On December 2 and 3, 2017, Babymetal performed at the Hiroshima Green Arena, with the shows \
        billed Legend "S" Baptism XX. This was the first time the group performed in Su-Metal hometown of Hiroshima, and it was an early coming of age celebration for her, since \
        December 20, 2017 was her 20th birthday (as hinted in the show title), the age of majority in Japan; the lyrics to "Headbangeeeeerrrrr!!!!", about a girl fifteenth birthday, \
        were even modified for the occasion. This was also Babymetal first performance without all three members, as Yuimetal was unable to perform due to illness. On December 30, 2017, \
        Kami Band guitarist Mikio Fujioka fell from an observation deck; he died from his injuries on January 5, 2018. Babymetal released a eulogy on Twitter on January 9, commemorating \

    'tekstas': 'Most of Japanese pop idols show a bright atmosphere, light music, smiles and a charming face. However, Lorraine Plourde has argued that Babymetal reminds people of a \
        slightly darker, slightly more complex version of cuteness. The band defines its style as a new genre called "kawaii metal" ("kawaii" meaning "cute") and clarifies that it is \
        "a mix of J-pop idol and heavy metal".The group has also been described as alternative metal, death metal, power metal, nu metal and speed metal. Tristan Peterson of Metal \
        Obsession remarked in his review of the band debut album "This band was created for the demographic of Music that your Japanese Boyfriend/Girlfriend, who doesnt really like \
        Metal, would enjoy. as well as (Babymetal) has made metal cute without losing any of its edge. Patrick St. Michel from Japanese music and culture site MTV 81 praises the pure, \
        headbang-inducing energy of the group live performances and describes their style as a mixture of ...seemingly disparate sounds of heavy metal and idol pop, creating music \
        anchored both by throat-mauling screeches and cuddly choruses. Lyrical themes found in Babymetal music focus on real-world issues. Also, they give the message of positivity \
        and self-empowerment with the atmosphere of their music containing less serious and playful themes. To be specific, the body image concerns of girls and women pressured by \
        society to remain thin and also bullying, while they also sing about what it like going to your first concert, the concept of an ideal woman and chocolate, subjects which \
        critics say are a step away from typical lyrical styles used by most metal bands. Writing for the Journal of Popular Music Studies, Sarah Keith and Diane Hughes characterized \
        Babymetal as a prime example of the genre of idol pop being of girls, but not for girls, exemplifying the broader J-pop trend of performative girlhood. While they remarked on \
        the band sharing many similarities with other idol groups, they also commented on Su-metal vocal delivery being markedly different from them, as she demonstrates a strong \
        voice with clear tone and a minimal amount of coloratura or embellishment. The authors noted the disparity in the band international audiences—stemming primarily from metal \
        communities—and their Japanese audience, consisting mostly of male idol fans. They concluded that Babymetal, among other idol groups, show girls as an idealized figure, neither \
        produced nor consumed by girls, but enacted by performers who are girls for the male gaze. In an analysis of Babymetal lyrics across their debut and sophomore albums, \
        Babymetal and Metal Resistance, musicologist Lewis F. Kennedy commented on the contrast between their often adolescent themes and the grim aesthetics of the metal genre. He also \
        remarked on the frequent use of wordplay in their first album, reinforcing the childish nature of the lyrics. The more extensive usage of English vocabulary in Metal Resistance \
        Kennedy saw as an effort from the band to internationalize the themes of their album to reach a wider audience. He characterized this development as making it more traditionally \
        metal, which metal fans would find more authentic. He also perceived the album overarching themes of collective resistance to be a departure from both their earlier work and \
        more traditional idol music.'

        either side of her in a triangle formation. In the band early years, the band members did not speak directly to the audience, or smile at the crowd, but over time the band has \
        incorporated more audience engagement and call and responses into their performances. Between songs, Babymetal does not engage with the crowd. Instead, there is a blackout, or, \
        in situations where that is not possible, they will freeze in a pose or turn away from the crowd. Babymetal costumes take a variety of cues from the popular Japanese Gothic and \
        Punk Lolita styles, with an emphasis on red and black. During the 2018 World Tour, due to Yuimetal absence, the band performed with Moametal and Su-metal in front of one \
        another, using risers to separate, while two backup dancers perform at the sides of the stage. Since her official departure, the traditional triangle formation has been \
        restored, with a non-singing backup dancer performing in Yuimetal place. Instead of the sign of the horns, the band uses the hand gesture of the kitsune to symbolise the band \
        supposed divine inspiration. Initially, the band members were shown photos of the sign of the horns, but mistook it for the head of a fox. Rather than correct the error, the \
        management accepted the kitsune sign as the band sign. Additionally, Babymetal style of moshing, known as mosh sh (モッシュッシュ, mosshusshu), has been described a safe, fun, \
        friendly game of push and shove. In their concerts, Babymetal are accompanied by a backing band. In their early stages, the backing band consisted of the "Babybones"—a group of \
        nameless individuals dressed in skeleton costumes that would mime live performances while pre-recorded studio tracks were being used. In late 2012, Babymetal debuted a live band \
        for their live performances which they referred to as "Full Metal Band" - a group of live musicians dressed in white robes and corpse paint. They have since been referred to by \
        band members and fans as "Gods of Metal" and more recently "Kami Band". From late 2012 to early 2014, the two groups would alternate, with the Kami Band being used more for \
        festival appearances and special events. At the Babymetal Death Match Tour in May 2013, the Kami Band performed all music live for the first time. As of early 2014, the \
        Babybones band has been quietly retired, and the Kami Band has since been established as Babymetal primary backing band. The Kami Band has consisted of a rotating line-up of \
        different musicians since its debut in late 2012. As of early 2018, however, the line-up has been relatively stable, consisting of guitarists Takayoshi Ohmura, Leda, and Isao, \
        bassist Boh, and drummer Hideki Aoyama with guitarists occasionally substituting for one another if needed. Kami Band member Leda has contributed to Babymetal music, most \
        notably on their album Metal Resistance (credited as Ledametal). Babymetal music videos, which showcase their distinct visual aesthetic, have helped the band gain broad \
        attention. Their video for "Gimme Chocolate!!" went viral in 2014 with USA Today Brian Mansfield commenting that the "video looks like some kind of bizarre animé, with a \
        dark-goth set and band members playing in skeleton costumes, and the three girls execute intricate choreography, flash heart signs and make windmill arm motions like they re \
        playing air guitar" In regards to their music video for the song "Karate", Moametal said that she "very proud that they are now representing this culture that came from Japan \
        through their music, and it a way for more people outside of Japan to also learn what karate is all about." The lyrics talk about never giving up and moving forward. Yuimetal \
        stated that the choreography for the song represented the lyrics and that "it important to be able to express the messages that they want to put across through the music with \
        their dance moves." The majority of their lyrics are in Japanese and they see their choreography as a way to break the language barrier.'

        branching out to the metal genre via Babymetal, noting her own lack of experience of metal before joining the band. On December 10, 2013, Babymetal released "Babymetal \
        Apocalypse", an incomplete binder that would be gradually filled with pages intermittently made available later. Pages would include the lore of Babymetal, artwork and photos, \
